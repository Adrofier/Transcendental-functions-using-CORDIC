# Transcendental-functions-using-CORDIC
This project describes the verilog implementation of CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) Algorithm which is used to calculate efficiently the values of sin, cos and tan functions and this code can also be synthesized in any FPGA.  
This does also include a simple testbench just to see the working of the Algorithm and does doesn't cover full the design.
